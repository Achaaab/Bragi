# Bragi
Bragi is a modular, real-time, sound synthesizer written in Java. Following modules are provided:
* ADSR: envelope generator with Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release parameters
* LFO: Low Frequency Oscillator
* VCO: Voltage Controlled Oscillator
* VCA: Voltage Controlled Amplifier
* VCF: Voltage Controlled Filter (with low-pass or high-pass response)
* Keyboard: a basic keyboard based on computer keyboard (from F3 to E6)
* Oscilloscope: basic oscilloscope
* SpectrumAnalyzer: basic spectrum analyzer
* Mp3FilePlayer: basic MP3 file player
* WavFilePlayer: basic WAV file player
* WhiteNoiseGenerator: white noise generator
* PinkNoiseGenerator: pink noise generator
* Theremin: some kind of theremin (with just pitch and volume, not the incredible timbre of the real instrument)
* Sampler: an experimentation to change the sample rate or sample size
* Ditherer: an experimentation with dithering
* Speaker: a module connected to your speakers
* Microphone: a module connected to your microphone
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
* Java 14 (depending on your IDE, you may have to add the JVM option `--enable-preview`)
* Maven 3.6.1
* Git 2.17.1
### Installing
* Clone the repository from github.com:
```
git clone git@github.com:Achaaab/Bragi.git
```
* Import the project Bragi in your IDE.
* Run the main class `com.github.achaaab.bragi.Test`.
## Examples
### MP3 file player connected to speaker
```java
var player = new Mp3FilePlayer(TEST_MP3_PATH);
var speaker = new Speaker();

player.getOutputs().get(0).connect(speaker.getInputs().get(0));
player.getOutputs().get(1).connect(speaker.getInputs().get(1));
```
### Keyboard connected to VCO and VCO connected to speaker
```java
var keyboard = new Keyboard();
var vco = new VCO();
var speaker = new Speaker();
var oscilloscope = new Oscilloscope();

keyboard.connectTo(vco);
vco.connectTo(oscilloscope);
speaker.connectFrom(vco, vco);
```
